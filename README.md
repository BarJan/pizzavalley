Responsive Web Page

A web page I developed using html, css, javascript and php from scratch.
Page validates form, sends it via mail, and responses well for window's width adjustment.
All website's UI files, fonts and styles taken from PSD files.
Website is responsive also for mobile devices, and on mobile view it has a Click-2-Call button that works only on certain day\hours, using JS script for conditions.
